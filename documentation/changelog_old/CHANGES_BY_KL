KL, Aug 29, 2004 :
==================

- Fixed some small things (e.g. uniform use of in/de crease_throttle, also in
  crrc_keyboard.c and the reset of joystick axis/buttons in crrc_main main() ).
- Added very simple sound support using SDL_audio and SDL_thread.

KL, July 24, 2004 :
===================

- Reworked the zoomfunctions : we now have zoomin(), zoomout() and
  set_zoom() to avoid reduncancy for joystick, keyboard and mouse zoom.

- Increaded the maximum number of joystick buttons to 6 and added the
  possibility of binding joystick zooming to the config file.
  
- Made a more clever mechanism for parsing the joystick axes and button
  options as the previous mechanism was unmanageable for larger numbers
  of buttons/axes (crrc_parse_config.c).

KL, July 21, 2004 :
===================

- Fixed a typo in keyboard rudder control (swapped left and right).

KL, July 18, 2004 :
===================

- Added some joystick options to the cmdline
- Repainted the very yellow spirit.air (spirit-color.air)

KL, July 17, 2004 :
===================

CODE cleanup :

- Made crrc_parse-config.c into a real separate object. Had to add a lot of
  external variables to crrc_main.h to make this work.

- Moved key_down() routine to separate object crrc_keyboard.c . crrc_main.c
  is already loosing some fat now ;)

- Added "default" option to switch() inside key_down() to stop compiler
  warnings about SDL enumerators when using the option -Wall

- Adapted Makefile for Linux to have compiler flag "-Wall". This produces a lot
  more warnings during compilation but shows much better where the weak points
  are. Of course in the future the code should also compile without any
  warnings with the -Wall option turned on ;)

KL, July 16, 2004 :
===================

EXTENSIONS and CODE cleanup :

- Extended the number of commandline options with some more useful variables

- Created a separate crrc_main.h by removing all defines, includes and
  typedefs from crrc_main.c

- Renamed crrc_parse_config.h to crrc_parse_config.c as it is NOT a header
  file but contains source code ! For the time being still included in
  crrc_main.c but should be made into a separate object later

- Adapted the Makefiles to remove crrc_parse_config from the HEADER files

KL 0.8.4 :
==========

- Added wind_velocity option (-w)
- Added aileron control using keyboard (F11 / F12) 
- Moved throttle to PG/UP DOWN (like in FlightGear)
- Moved elevator keyboard control to CRSR UP/DOWN
- Streamlined glut-3.7/gle and added simple Makefile

KL 0.8.3 :
==========

- Added commandline options for airfield, input (mouse or keyboard) and
  fullscreen in a new source crrc_checkopts.c

KL 0.8.2 :
==========

- Added Gle and Glut to the package to make compilation a little easier
- Removed #include glutil.h in crrc_main.c
- Fixed some small compilation warnings in 2 headerfiles (#endif)
- Added precompiled crrcsim binary and precompiled libgle.a
- Changed the Makefile :
  - Use GLE and GLUT headers from the package
  - Compile each object file individually to speedup compilation after
    small modifications
  - make clean doesn't remove the binary anymore (but make veryclean does)
  NOTE : it now uses some Gnu Make tricks which should work on all Gnu make
         based systems (but maybe not on standard MS-Windows ?) If not just 
	 change CRRC_OBJECTS and list them manually ;)
- Enabled cmdline option parser and help in ls_interface.c and main()
- Changed read_airplane_file() to be able to get plane from cmdline again
- Added keyboard control for the elevator in special() KEY_PGUP / KEY_PGDOWN)
- Added a "reset to decent values" from keyboard (KEY_HOME)
- Currently the binary prints the rudder position, throttle and other values
  in the console as soon as they are changed from the keyboard 
- Changed introduction.txt to document new keyboard controls
- Changed the default crrsim.cfg to start at DAVIS and without any wind 
  (which is much easier for beginners like me ;)
- Made the default.air plane a softlink to the real one

TODO :

- improve commandline options : choose plane, airport and control
- add menubar with some menus to change plane, airport etc. "on the fly"
- change keyboard rudder and elevator control to return to neutral (or trim)
  position automatically if key is released (like in most other Sims)
- Add an optional live indicator that shows the current value of thrust,
  elevator and rudder somewhere on the screen
- add sound !

DONE :
x move defines from crrc_main.c to new crrc_main.h and include this in
  crrc_checkopts.c
